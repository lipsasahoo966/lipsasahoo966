## 👋 Hi, I’m Lipsa!

- I'm a senior graduate from Department of Geology 🌏, Banaras Hindu University pursuing MSc in Geology. 
- 👀 I am a passionate and curious learner who loves to analyse, compare and contrast and solve problems as well as making a mark in the society through impactful work.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying my hands on data science and hope to get something fruitful out of my current knowledge of earth sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, R and other machine learning libraries such as Matplotlib and so on (various  other tools required for data analytics).
- 📫 You can reach me via  ...
